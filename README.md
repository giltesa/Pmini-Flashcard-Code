# Pmini Flashcard - ONLY CODE

Code for the **Flash cartridge for the Pokémon Mini** console, built around the **Raspberry Pi RP2040** microcontroller platform. It **includes 16 MB of onboard memory** to load and run games, along with a **USB-C** interface for convenient firmware updates and game transfers.

This repository is dedicated exclusively to the code. It is a fork and a customized version of two repositories from zwenergy:

* The first repository contains the main code, including the firmware and the WebApp:
  [http://github.com/zwenergy/PM2040](http://github.com/zwenergy/PM2040)

* The second repository contains the game selection menu:

## Attributions

*   This project was designed entirely from scratch, but it was inspired by the [PM2040 project by zwenergy](https://github.com/zwenergy/PM2040), who created an adapter for soldering a [Waveshare RP2040 Zero](https://www.waveshare.com/rp2040-zero.htm), along with software tools for flashing the microcontroller. It intentionally uses the same pinout to ensure compatibility with his software. Many thanks to [zwenergy](https://github.com/zwenergy) for his excellent work! His code was used as a base and adapted for this cartridge.
